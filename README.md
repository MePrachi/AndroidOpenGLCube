Android OpenGL App. Make the cube face where your phone/tablet is facing

This application uses the inertial sensors of the phone/tablet such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer to find the orientation of the phone, and draw a colorful cube with that orientation on the screen using OpenGL ES 2.0.
